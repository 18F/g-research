title:  "Usability Test Quality Heuristics"
---

<p>The following indicators can help determine if a usability test will
produce useful results. This is not an exhaustive list, but it should be
helpful in planning and assessing usability tests ‚Äî additions welcome!</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Indicator</th>
      <th>Good sign</th>
      <th>Bad sign</th>

    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">Study design</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Study purpose</td>
      <td>Researcher clearly articulates the purpose of the usability test (for example, as a specific question to answer, an area of inquiry, etc.).</td>
      <td>Researcher does not specify a purpose for the test, or the purpose specified is very broad, like &ldquo;testing the app&rdquo; or &ldquo;finding problems.&rdquo;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of participants</td>
      <td>Tests include a sufficient number of participants necessary to see patterns, and there&rsquo;s only one participant per session.</td>
      <td>Studies includes only one participant, or studies include multiple participants tested simultaneously (like a focus group üò± ).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sampling bias</td>
      <td>Participants are people who actually use the application (or do the task the application is supposed to support).</td>
      <td>Participants are experts (vs. average users), friends, family, or close colleagues of the product team.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">Moderator style</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Question style</td>
      <td>Researcher asks follow up questions that are open-ended and non-leading.</td>
      <td>Questions are leading or subtly suggest potential solutions or hypotheses.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Task variability</td>
      <td>Researcher asks participants to complete similar tasks related to the study‚Äôs purpose.</td>
      <td>Researcher asks participants to complete different tasks, or tasks unrelated to the study‚Äôs purpose.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Framing</td>
      <td>Researcher asks participants to complete tasks with the product or service that align with their work-related goals.</td>
      <td>Researcher asks participants to complete tasks unrelated to their work-related goals. For example, asking a participant how they might send a fax when their job doesn‚Äôt call for that.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Priming</td>
      <td>Moderator asks participants to complete tasks without indicating how that might be done. For example, ‚ÄúHow would you view the status of your application?‚Äù</td>
      <td>Researcher guides participants in completing tasks. For example, ‚ÄúWhich of the links in the header would you click to login?‚Äù</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">Team participation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of teammates</td>
      <td>The team designates a single moderator for the test, and at least one member of the product team observes the usability test.</td>
      <td>A single person from the product team participates in and leads the test.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Observer role</td>
      <td>Observers do not moderate. They are generally quiet, and ask open-ended questions after the test has concluded.</td>
      <td>Observers interrupt the participant, or attempt to sell or explain the product. Observers debate the participant‚Äôs actions in their presence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">Sensemaking</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Notetaking</td>
      <td>Tests are recorded or notes are taken for sharing with absent stakeholders.</td>
      <td>No notes or records are produced during the test. Tests are not recorded.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Synthesis</td>
      <td>Moderator debriefs with teammates immediately after each interview. Researcher looks for patterns across multiple participants and surfaces problems that affected several people.</td>
      <td>Moderator reports the most memorable problems without conducting affinity mapping or some other analysis technique.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Presentation of findings</td>
      <td>Researcher reports findings to team and stakeholders in an easy to follow, well prioritized way.</td>
      <td>Researcher presents team a &ldquo;basket of issues&rdquo; or an unprioritized laundry list of potential changes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Incorporation of findings</td>
      <td>Product team translates findings into future user stories or product refinements.</td>
      <td>Researcher reports do not affect the product backlog or ongoing development work.</td>
