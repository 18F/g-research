# TTS Research Guild

The TTS Research Guild is a community of practice for TTS staff interested in design research. To join the guild, simply [join the #g-research channel on Slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C03JK2KH8) and ask [a lead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGlH1_RY0YQufSZzntMYFKzKS5X3skIriImE0M_2Kjk/edit#heading=h.ogel0f44ifru) to be added to our weekly meetings. Members generally attend weekly meetings, share articles and anecdotes, discuss best practices, review research plans, etc. 

Guild meetings are Wednesdays, from 2-2:30 EST, and generally serve as a forum for addressing questions from members related to topics such as research administration, creating and disseminating surveys, research participant recruiting strategies, informing and collecting voluntary consent, recording feedback on people's use and perception of government services, data practices (for example, creating, archiving, sharing, and deleting records) data minimization (for example, de-identifying recordings), conducting shared analysis or synthesis, creating research artifacts documenting findings (for example, a report detailing usability errors).

Occasionally, one or two members will share how theyâ€™ve conducted research on their last/current project. We're also experimenting with [inviting outside speakers](https://github.com/18F/g-research/blob/master/speaking.md) to share with guild. Notes are taken at most meetings.
