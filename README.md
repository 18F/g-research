# TTS Research Guild

The TTS Research Guild is a community of practice for TTS staff interested in design research. To join the guild, simply [join the #g-research channel on Slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C03JK2KH8) and ask [a lead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGlH1_RY0YQufSZzntMYFKzKS5X3skIriImE0M_2Kjk/edit#heading=h.ogel0f44ifru) to be added to our weekly meetings. Members generally attend weekly meetings, share articles and anecdotes, discuss best practices, review research plans, etc. 

Guild meetings are Wednesdays, from 2-2:30 EST, and the format is largely unstructured. Sometimes we'll discuss a few of the big questions that researchers tend to wrestle with (“how can we invite a more diverse group of people to participate in our research?”); at other times, one or two members will share how they’ve conducted research on their last/current project. Notes are taken at most meetings.
