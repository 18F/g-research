# TTS Research Guild

The TTS Research Guild is a GSA-local community of practice for design researchers and design-research enthusiasts. To join the guild, simply [join the #g-research channel on the GSA-TTS Slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C03JK2KH8) and ask [a lead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGlH1_RY0YQufSZzntMYFKzKS5X3skIriImE0M_2Kjk/edit#heading=h.ogel0f44ifru) to be added to our weekly meetings, Wednesdays, from 2-2:30 EST. 


## Vision 

We envision a world where government agencies use design research to proactively shape their decision-making processes and to inform their design decisions


## Mission

We exist to build an active, informed, inclusive community of practice for design researchers and design-research enthusiasts here at TTS. We will do this by:

- Inviting participation from across GSA/TTS (18F, OPP, PIF, etc.)
- Inviting [luminaries outside of GSA to speak](https://github.com/18F/g-research/blob/master/speaking.md)
- Raising awareness of the importance and methods of design research across GSA
- Leading discussions on topics of shared interest (like research participant recruiting; see below) and best practices
- Helping members develop the sensitivites to navigate culturally complex research environments
- Creating safe spaces for peer feedback, and encouraging reflective practice
- Helping one another get research done (for example, by collaborating on interview guides), 
- Highlighting opportunities to plan, observe (shadow), practice, and reflect on research
- Co-creating reusable documentation, templates, resources
- Sharing topical articles, videos, etc.


## Topics of interest

- Research administration
- Creating and disseminating surveys
- Research participant recruiting strategies
- Informing and collecting consent
- Recording feedback on people's use and perception of government services
- Navigating culturally complex research environments
- GSA-sanctioned Data practices (for example, creating, archiving, sharing, and deleting records) and data minimization techniques (for example, de-identifying recordings)
- Conducting shared analysis or synthesis 
- Creating research artifacts (for example, a report detailing usability errors).
- Legal, ethical, bias- and privacy-issues related to research
