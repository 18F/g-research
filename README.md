# TTS Research Guild

The TTS Research Guild is a community of practice for TTS staff interested in design research. To join the guild, simply [join the #g-research channel on Slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C03JK2KH8) and ask [a lead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGlH1_RY0YQufSZzntMYFKzKS5X3skIriImE0M_2Kjk/edit#heading=h.ogel0f44ifru) to be added to our weekly meetings. Members generally attend weekly meetings, share articles and anecdotes, discuss best practices, review research plans, etc. 

Guild meetings are Wednesdays, from 2-2:30 EST, and generally serve as a forum for addressing member questions related to topics such as:

- Research administration
- Creating and disseminating surveys
- Research participant recruiting strategies
- Informing and collecting voluntary consent
- Recording feedback on people's use and perception of government services
- Data practices (for example, creating, archiving, sharing, and deleting records) and data minimization techniques (for example, de-identifying recordings)
- Conducting shared analysis or synthesis 
- Creating research artifacts (for example, a report detailing usability errors).

In addition to the above, we also discuss legal, ethical, bias- and privacy-related questions. Occasionally, one or two members will share how theyâ€™ve conducted research on their last/current project. We're also experimenting with [inviting outside speakers](https://github.com/18F/g-research/blob/master/speaking.md) to share with guild. Notes are taken at most meetings.
