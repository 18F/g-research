# TTS Research Guild Co-Lead Role Description


## Objectives

Co-leads spend an average of **three hours a week** working towards the following objectives (in collaboration with their co-lead and members, as appropriate):


### Objective A: Maintain the guild as a community of practice

- Recruit new members and increase member participation
- Coordinate regular opportunities for engagement and community building (for example, weekly meetings, bi-weekly bulletins)
- Help members in identifying and sharing their knowledge, both tacit and explicit (for example, by taking notes while members present to the guild)
- Drive consensus around what constitutes good research, and celebrate practitioners and projects modelling good research


### Objective B: Chart a path for the guild

- Establish and pursue [annual goals](https://github.com/18F/g-research/wiki/TTS-Research-Guild-Objectives-for-2019) for the guild
- Establish guild-sanctioned projects (for example, drafting a privacy impact assessment for design research) 
- Solicit contributions from guild members (for example, ask members to speak, mentor, or join a working group)


### Objective C: Advocate for and evangelize research

- Serve as a point of contact for other design- and research-friendly government communities (for example, GSA’s Customer Experience Community of Practice, and the [Federal User Experience Community of Practice](https://digital.gov/communities/user-experience/))
- Identify opportunities to evangelize research (for example, speaking opportunities or opportunities to co-author a digital.gov blog post), and connect members to those opportunities, as appropriate
- Raise awareness of research as a driver of value at TTS (For example, in collaboration with the [18F Methods Product Owner](https://github.com/18F/methods/blob/staging/PRODUCT_OWNER.md), collect usage metrics for research-related methods)
- Advocate for tools, policies, and other documentation that will enable broader adoption of design research
