# Research Guild Co-Lead Role Description


## Objectives

Co-leads spend an average of **three hours a week** working towards the following objectives (in collaboration with their co-lead and members, as appropriate):


### Objective A: Maintain the guild as a community of practice

- Recruit new members, and increase member participation
- Coordinate regular opportunities for engagement and community building (for example, weekly meetings)
- Help members in identifying and sharing their tacit knowledge (for example, by taking notes while members present to the guild)
- Drive consensus around what constitutes good research, and celebrate practitioners and projects modelling good research


### Objective B: Chart a path for the guild

- Establish and pursue [annual goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReAVduSUc7GsBQixaLJDNETHD3Lg82-VdGnGqxlSxHE/edit#heading=h.92c5gxf5vmtt) for the guild

- Solicit contributions from guild members, as appropriate


### Objective C: Advocate for and evangelize research

- Identify opportunities to evangelize research (for example, speaking opportunities or opportunities to co-author a digital.gov blog post), and connect members to those opportunities, as appropriate
- Raise awareness of research as a driver of value at TTS (For example, in collaboration with the [18F Methods Product Owner](https://github.com/18F/methods/blob/staging/PRODUCT_OWNER.md), collect usage metrics for research-related methods)
